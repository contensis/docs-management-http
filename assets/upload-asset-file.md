## Upload asset file

A file is required to be uploaded to the asset resource endpoint before an asset can be created. A content type of multipart/form-data is used to perform the upload. A file id is returned for a successful upload which then can be used as a file reference in a [AssetFile](/model/assetfile.md) field when creating an asset. Multiple files can be uploaded in a single request with the resulting file ids returning in the same order as they are uploaded.
