# Errors

Status codes and error responses you can encounter when using the API.

The Management API returns error details in a generic format so that it can be easily handled in a consistent way. Detailed error information is not exposed in the response to ensure security sensitive details are not leaked.

## Typical HTTP status codes

Below are the current status codes returned from the Management API.

| Status code | Error code   | Description                                                                   |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400         | BadRequest   | The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.       |
| 403         | AccessDenied | The action is not authorised for the current user.                            |
| 404         | NotFound     | The resource was not found.                                                   |
| 500         | ServerError  | An error occurred on the server. Something went wrong processing the request. |


## Error response

Each response follows the same rules.

| Name | Type | Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| logId | string | GUID | The logId as a 128 bit GUID.<br />This can be used within the Contensis [log search](https://zenhub.zengenti.com/contensis/12.0/kb/tools-and-utilities/log-search/log-search-overview.aspx) to understand further details about the error. |
| message | string | | A description of the error. |
| data | any | | An object containing specific data relevant to the error. |
| type | string | | The type of error - for the Delivery API, this will always be *error*. |
