# Localization

Localization for an entry is identified by a language code which is formed using a [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code, or a combination of a [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code and a [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) country code. Effectively, a Contensis language code can represent a language generically or specifically for a certain country.

The language code is in lowercase and if the country code is included, then it is separated with a dash and uppercased.

## Language code examples

* English is represented as **en**
* American English is represented as **en-US**
* Germany German is represented as **de-DE**

## Supported languages

Contensis currently supports a subset of [language codes](https://zenhub.zengenti.com/Contensis/10/kb/content-types-and-entries/entries/multi-language-support.aspx) which can be set when creating a project, and enabled against a content type.
